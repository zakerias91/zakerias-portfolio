## ⚠️ Important – Original Template Attribution

The visual design and original HTML/CSS template were created by a third-party designer who retains all rights to that template.

- This repository **does not** include the original `theme.css` (or any of the other theme CSS files) that were part of that template.
- Those files are **not licensed for redistribution** and are excluded from this project.
- Only my own redevelopment work (React components, Next.js pages, animations, configuration, and logic) is included here.

If you want to use the original design or themes, you must obtain them from the original creator.
